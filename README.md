I have uploaded a starting file for our project. It includes all relevant files from Mod 6 (tweaked insurance, auto insurance, art insurance, life insurance and health insurance blueprints for menu item 7, customer class, and a reformatted TrackInsurance driver). The FileLoc class from Mod 7 (for menu items 7 & 8) and a new MenuInfo class are also present in the new file. The altered track insurance class has -1 thru 7 working, as well as 999 to quit. Menu items 8,9,10,11 still need to be completed, but stub methods have been written for these in MenuInfo.
